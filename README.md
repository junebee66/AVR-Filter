>AVR filter is a software that recolors and re-positions the pixels on users’ mobile devices to depict 3D illusions that is similar to the visual people see in theaters for 3D films. This product aims to bridge the gap between current 2D device users into familiarizing 3D interaction with their daily used software to migrate them into using 3D devices (VR headsets and AR glasses).
