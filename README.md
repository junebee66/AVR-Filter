![image is not loaded, please try again](./source/poster.jpg)
This software allows users to see their usual content on moblie devices coming out into their reality with the three dimensional visual orientation. Without buying a 3D TV, purchasing 3D produced films, wearing VR headset, or only see augumented reality in certain apps. AVR filter is a lightweight algorithm on mobile screens that runs across all platforms to bring the internet world into the real life.

**1️⃣ Virtual 3D Scene**</br>
>[📀 Youtube Test Mockup Here 📀](https://github.com/junebee66/AVR-Filter/weglAnaglyph/youtube.html)</br>
> This is a virtual 3D scene with a YouTube UI Mockup. The color of the scene is distorted with the Anaglyph Effect, so users are able to see a 3D UI when they wear Anaglyph glasses </br>

**2️⃣ Video to 3D**</br>
> Here are 3 film trailers you can watch in 3D with Anaglyph glasses. Each of these videos are running through the color distortion algorithm I made to stream in live with the anaglyph effect on broswer.</br>

### **💡About**
![image is not loaded, please try again](./source/logo-black.jpg)
>AVR filter is a software that recolors and re-positions the pixels on users’ mobile devices to depict 3D illusions that is similar to the visual people see in theaters for 3D films. This product aims to bridge the gap between current 2D device users into familiarizing 3D interaction with their daily used software to migrate them into using 3D devices (VR headsets and AR glasses).
