> This is a virtual 3D scene with a YouTube UI Mockup. The color of the scene is distorted with the Anaglyph Effect, so users are able to see a 3D UI when they wear Anaglyph glasses </br>

**2️⃣ Video to 3D**</br>
> Here are 3 film trailers you can watch in 3D with Anaglyph glasses. Each of these videos are running through the color distortion algorithm I made to stream in live with the anaglyph effect on broswer.</br>

### **💡About**
![image is not loaded, please try again](./source/logo-black.jpg)
>AVR filter is a software that recolors and re-positions the pixels on users’ mobile devices to depict 3D illusions that is similar to the visual people see in theaters for 3D films. This product aims to bridge the gap between current 2D device users into familiarizing 3D interaction with their daily used software to migrate them into using 3D devices (VR headsets and AR glasses).
